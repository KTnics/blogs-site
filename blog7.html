                        Brands across the globe are slowly coming to terms with the volatile business environment we have
						found ourselves in with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether your company has
						temporarily frozen operations or has decided to implement an innovation-driven remote working
						system, how you approach your digital marketing strategy should be a primary focus in these
						worrying times ahead - if it is not already.
					   <h1> inspiring digital marketing strategies in covid-19 are as follows:- </h1>
					<br>
                    <br>
						
							<h1>Social Media Marketing</h1>
							
								There’s no doubt that social media is a huge gathering space for people around the
								world. When you commit to marketing on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and even YouTube,
								you get the chance to connect with thousands of potential customers daily without
								spending much for views.
							
								Social media marketing is a great strategy for any business owner who has a younger
								audience or doesn’t have the budget for pricier Google Ads. Through this marketing
								channel, you can increase brand awareness using organic posts. Plus, you can support
								your organic content by adding paid, targeted ads, or influencer posts—which you control
								the budget for—to your social media plan on each platform. Social media also gives you
								the chance to increase loyalty, as users can engage directly with you and get a human
								response.
						<br>

						<br>
							<h1> Content Marketing</h1>
							   If you want to focus on providing as much value to your potential customers as possible
								during the marketing process, content marketing—specifically, marketing with long-form
								articles and blogs—is a great strategy.
							<br>
								While blogging and writing Medium articles may not immediately lead to sales, it’s a
								highly effective way to draw your target audience into your sales funnel. By providing
								the information they want to receive as they search for solutions, your articles can
								also boost your SEO. Because of this, content marketing can actually generate three
								times the leads per dollar spent than paid search marketing.
						<br>
                        <br>
						
							<h1>Word of Mouth Marketing</h1>
							    Now that online reviews are the new word of mouth, this type of marketing strategy isn’t
								the same as it used to be. However, digital referrals still pack the same power as
								in-person referrals. People trust people—so much so that 68% of consumers will form an
								opinion after reading as little as one to six reviews.
							    A word-of-mouth marketing strategy can give your brand instant credibility as real people
								vouch for your brand after a real experience. Your current customer base is one of your
								most effective marketing tools, not to mention one that’s completely free. All you need
								to do is ask.
