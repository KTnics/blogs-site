       In the world of Search Engine Optimization, trends tend to change with time. And there are a lot
        of SEO
        tips out there. Let us know about some of the important ones:
    <br>
    <br>
            <h1>Creating content around Primary and Secondary Keywords:
            </h1>
                Keyword research is at the core of every effective keyword strategy. Both Primary and
                Secondary
                keywords are used in the formation of a great content and knowing how to use them will
                definitely
                lead searchers to the website. Primary Keyword should always be the main focus of your
                leading
                page. It should contain a strong description of what your page is about and what your
                brand does.
                These primary keywords should be the main focus of the whole content. <br>Secondary
                keywords are supporting words which are related to the primary keywords. By using
                secondary keywords, you will increase the ranking of your website.
        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Remove things that loads slowly:
            </h1>
                You should know that your page time affects your SEO. These pages have higher bounce
                rates. It
                is obvious that the longer it will take to load the page, the less time the visitors
                will spend on your
                page. You should always check the speed of your site. Always remember to review your
                website.
                Check if any elements are there which are dragging down the load time, like any
                unnecessary
                plug-in? Remove or restructure them and you will likely observe an increase in the
                traffic on your
                website.
                <br>
                <br>
            <h1>Always publish the original work/content:</h1>
               When you add new pages to your website, it is very important to make sure that you are
                pulling
                the original content and avoiding the duplicate one. Especially if there is a presence
                of heavy
                blogging in your industry, it would be more preferable to do it in rankings.<br>
                Search Engine Algorithms, particularly Google, are specially designed to sniff out the
                content
                which is unique. It is believed that those who publish the original content and are good
                in
                practicing SEO are most likely to turn up higher in search list. In the past, there were
                a few
                websites which were removed from search engine lists for plagiarizing their content. So
                originality is always the key!
        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Make sure that your content is evergreen:</h1>
               For any inbound marketing strategy, EVERGREEN is the best gift which always keeps on
                giving.
                This content is meant to stand the test of time. You should make sure that your content
                should be
                relevant today as well as 5 years from today. This helps to bring traffic on your
                website
                continuously over the time and helps in bringing more visitors to your page.<br>
                While creating evergreen content, have an idea about what things will help to retain its
                long term
                value to the readers. Always try to remove things like breaking news or any timely news,
                anything
                which involves data that is meant to change over time, seasonal content, pop culture
                news and
                fashion news.
        <br>

                keeps on

                the basic skills; you must know the trending tool which keeps on changing all the time.

        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Format your content for search engines:</h1>
                Another thing which really matters is how you use your words and how you format your
                content.
                You must ensure that your content is as more informative as it can be. One the other
                hand it is also
                very important to make sure that it is easy to understand, friendly for readers, and in
                the right
                format. Generally, length of sentences should not be more than 20 words. And while there
                should
                not just be a single paragraph, it is also important to check that the other paragraphs
                are not too
                long.
        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Increase your word count:</h1>
               It is very important to make sure that the content you are writing is comprehensive. It
                has a major
                role as it helps people to understand what your content is actually about and if they
                have any
                questions in their minds, they can find their answers in the content itself. At the same
                time you
                must ensure that your content is not too long. Higher word count also allows you to add
                more
                keywords.
