<br>
<br>

<h1>Iconic or Symbolic Logos</h1>
   Symbol or Iconic logo designs represent your company in a simple yet bold manner. The image
    should have a “real” connection with your business and styled in away that is visually
    interesting. The power of a logo lies in its visual nature.

<h1>Wordmark Logos</h1>
<br>

    spell out the company or brand name. Many times, custom fonts are created specifically for
    brands to use across all their marketing and branding collateral. Some examples include
    Facebook, Disney, Tiffany & Co. and Sony.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Lettermark Logos</h1>

    Lettermarks are exclusively typographelloc. They use a symbol representing the company through
    the use of its initials or the brand’s first letter.

   If the name is too long, hard to pronounce, or if it’s just not distinct enough to carry its own
    weight, it’s ideal to go for thellos type of logo design.
