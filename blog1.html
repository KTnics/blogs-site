        Sometimes you just want to know about what you should and what you should not do for your SEO.
        Below are some simple dos and don’ts for SEO, which will help you to create a successful SEO for
        your business.
    <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Know thyself and thy industry:</h1>
                Before you can begin to promote yourself with digital marketing, you need to understand
                who you really are as a brand. That means taking the time to think what you stand for
                and to whom you speak to. You speak differently to your parents when you are in family
                than you do when you are at bar. They are extremely different audiences. If you
                understand your audience, you will better understand the voice which you should speak.
                It is not enough to know thyself. You must know your industry too. If you sell gloves,
                you should be following the world greatest glove maker on social media, reading blogs
                and feeds from glove experts and attending different conferences for the same. You need
                to know everything about gloves! Take time everyday to read about you industry, even if
                it’s just 20 minutes.
        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Demonstrating passion in searchable way:</h3>
                A company whose employees and executives are vocal on channels they are trying to
                convince you to use it is extremely important. Their social media presence shows that
                how much they are passionate for the industry. It also shows whether they are committed
                to up to the mark and showcase their real life knowledge of how digital marketing works.
            
        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Maintaining team work:</h1>
                Creativity is not limited to just one person neither knowledge is. Some people in the
                agency are surely better than others in some or the other thing like in technical
                aspects of a website, while someone else may demonstrate an affinity for social media,
                and some other might have a voice that resonates with the readers. A good agency
                maintains teamwork and does collaborations which help their agency to get a pull of all
                these knowledge together to develop a program which can attract and engage the audience.
                It has the extra bonus of providing more points of contact for you, and also creating
                higher degree of support for the program.
        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Staying in a constant contact:</h1>
                It is important to work with an agency that sets expectation in term of what you can
                expect from them, and what expect from you. Frequent meetings, follow ups and time to
                time reporting helps to make sure if all the objectives of the program are being met or
                not also it shows your dedication to success. An agency that does this is more likely to
                share updates with you.
        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Diversify:</h1>
                Because the digital space is consistently changing, good digital marketing agencies make
                sure their strategies are spread out across multiple disciples. This means focusing not
                just on Search Engine Optimization (SEO) or social media. Certain elements of search
                engine optimization, social media, paid advertising and content are timeless. But,
                diversifying also means shifting digital marketing strategies as new ones develop. Not
                only you need to know about thy industry but you also need to know about what is current
                in digital marketing.
        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Be consistent:</h1>
                It is easy to do something once, but it is difficult to do the same thing day in and day
                out. Digital marketing is all about here and now. It is always changing. What was true
                yesterday may not be true today. Good digital marketing industries consistently add new
                things and update their posts. They aim for:
            <br>
                
                   Ongoing search engine optimization
                   Regular monitoring on social media
                   Blog posts frequently
                   Frequent paid advertisement adjustments
            <br>
            
        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Use right tools:</h1>
                 A successful digital marketing industry knows the value of using the right tools as it
                save both time and energy. There are many digital marketing tools can be helpful to
                increase the traffic of your website and improve your conversion rate. If there is a
                tool that can ease the burden of time and budgeting constrains or a one that can
                dramatically improve your productivity – then you owe it to both yourself and you team
                to grab it with both hands.
        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Seek help whenever needed:</h1>
                No digital marketer is an island. The best digital marketers are never afraid to seek for
                help whenever needed. Although self motivation is integral to their career, they have
                the knowledge of teams, tribes and networks. They seek out the help and support of
                mentors- they ask questions, welcome feedback and take notes. On twitter, they reach out
                to influencers to ask for advice, to get quotes for articles and to receive help sharing
                their content.
        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Network and build new relationship:</h1>
                Networking is lifeblood of any agency. A successful Digital marketing agency keeps a
                steady flow of customers coming through the door to keep their business alive. They
                establish good relations with other industries also related professionals like web
                designers, graphic designers, photographers, content teams etc. because it’s a great way
                to get referral business. Maintaining relations with Professionals from the other
                industries are also a great source of information for their industry, to help them
                continue learning and make their digital marketing agency more successful.
        <br>
        <br>
            <h1>Maintaining diverse book of clients:</h1>
                This indicates that an agency is able to understand other industries. Spending time to
                look deeply into what makes agencies tick and evaluate their internal teamwork,
                organization and commitment to communication provides essential insights into how they
                treat their clients
